package expiry

//This is the node for the expiry heap. We just store the absolute expiry time and a pointer to the element key.
//Note that an entry on the heap does not guarantee that there's an entry on the storage map or that the map entry actually has expired. 
//The invariant is:
// Each entry in the storage map has at least one entry with the same key and ttl in the queue, or it's in the expiry channel buffer. This holds for the 'current' entry value at any given time, including updates

	Key     *string
	Exptime uint32

// The heap is implemented in an array, hence the type is an alias of HeapEntry slice.
// Note that as we want to support extensible heap capacities, functions like Push and Pop may change the underlying array (Push), or re-slice (Pop). In either case, we need a slice pointer, to be able to update it as a side-effect.
